    <description>By default, the D4 doesn't re-roll item wisps. This mod corrects that. Be warned that there seems to be a hard limit of 64 total familiars (including wisps). If you're close to the limit then you may end up with less item wisps after they've been re-rolled due to other familiars spawning. Other items that call the D4 (d100, d infinity, missing no, dice room, reverse wheel of fortune, etc) are also supported.

Item wisps will also be re-rolled when Tainted Eden takes damage.

Re-rolled item wisps will reset their hp.
